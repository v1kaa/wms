## Warehouse Management System (WMS)
This is my implementation of a Warehouse Management System (WMS). The application is designed to streamline warehouse operations and includes features to manage products, workers, suppliers, and export operations. The system also incorporates role-based access control to ensure users have access to the appropriate functionalities based on their roles.

To create this application, I used SQLite and built a well-structured relational dataset to ensure smooth and efficient operation of the app.


#### Roles and Access
###### Admin
Full access to all features and functionalities.
###### Logistic Clerk
Access to logistics and export-related functionalities.
View and manage export operations and supplier information.
No access to worker management.



The app also supports scaling
